This fix is based on code base of V 10.71,
which extends limit for length of tfm/vf font name.

This pack includes TeXWord.exe and DVIEW.exe in both Win32 and Win64 builds

It should work with version 10.70
It was also tested with version 10.65-150212
It may work with previous versions but without warranty.
V 10.71 and later already includes this fix.

To apply the fix just unpack http://www.bakoma-tex.com/dist/x1071/fix/fix-font-name-length.zip 
in BaKoMa TeX folder. 

Check that the files 
C:\BaKoMa TeX\BIN\Win32\TeXWord.exe
C:\BaKoMa TeX\BIN\Win32\DVIEW.exe
C:\BaKoMa TeX\BIN\Win64\TeXWord.exe
C:\BaKoMa TeX\BIN\Win64\DVIEW.exe
have been replaced.
