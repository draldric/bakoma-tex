This fix (2016/10/10) is based on code base of V 11.15,
which fix problem of running latexdiff from TeXWord

Tech: premature termination of piped programs with activity on non-redirected stderr channel.

This pack includes BaKoMa\PostLine.pl and BaKoMa\TeXWord\latexdiff.ctr

It should work with version 11.15 (may be before versions but untested)

To apply the fix just unpack 
http://www.bakoma-tex.com/dist/x1115/fix/latexdiff-fix161010.zip
in BaKoMa TeX folder. 

Check that the files 
BaKoMa\PostLine.pl and BaKoMa\TeXWord\latexdiff.ctr
have been replaced. 

NOTE: This fix will be included into V 11.16 (nearest test version)
