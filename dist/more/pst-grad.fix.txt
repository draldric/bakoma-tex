pst-grad package has very inefficient gradient fill 
procedure impelemented via 'for'.

My code uses PostScript shfill, 
which is good choose for TeXWord.

However, for editing slides background cache may be used.

Present versiosn of pst-grad.pro fix is not matched
with modern versiosn of pst-grad package.
So, it is moved from bakoma.bkz to this module.

When this will be uptodate, we will add this module 
to quicksetup.ini - also it will be more convenient to update 
it later.

In pricipal it may be better to use port directory and keep 
entire package ...



NOTE: 	Another advances are also required ...
