 	   (b) using pdfsavepos in DVIPS driver.

+2) linegoal - works well, it also get zref-savepos

?3) pxpgfmark - forces PGF/DVIPDFM driver to use pdfsavepos (should be supported if used)

?5) gridset, 

?6) marginnote - it also will work without pdfmode ...

?   fancytooltips, 

?   koma-script/scrlayer-notecolumn.sty, 

Already included upto date packages:

?1) (10.0) oberdiek/tabularht.sty/zref-dotfill.sty/zref-savepos.sty, (A new reference scheme for LaTeX).
=2) (9.0) t-angles - pdftex is one of drivers, others TPIC, EMTEX should work without problem.
?3) (9.0) changebar  - uses DVIPS driver by default, such that using pdfsavepos is avoided.

Some packages are out interest:

- pdfsync - has no sense with BaKoMa (BaKoMa Sync work much better and transparently)
