  Configuration system is completly changed as following:

  1) hBaKoMaX0.def driver is started from hdvips.def 
     instead of using hypertex.def as in previosu versions.

  2) This approach provide more complete compatibility with dvips 
     including pdfmark definitions, whose are ofen required
     by many presentation and multimedia packages.

  3) hdvips.def is now extremy simple as \input{hBaKoMaX0.def}

  Fixed problem related with memoir package 
  Added definitions of: 
	%\def\partnumberline#1{#1) }
	%\def\chapternumberline#1{#1) }

This package includes files to configure HyperRef
to work with BaKoMa TeX.

NOTE: Most of configuration files are coming together with 
      BaKoMa TeX Kernel. However, HyperRef is special package.
      HyperRef configuration conventions are frequently changed.
      In this reason, we must handle it in separate module
      which may be updated without BaKoMa TeX Kernel.

Standard bakoma configuration of HyperRef package 
must define pdfmark operator like to made in dvips.def

One problem which I have meet is related with movie15 package...

moview15 check that pdfmark defined when pdf = false, otherwise
alarm that HYperRef isn't loaded.
