This fix (2015/05/08) is based on code base of V 10.81,
which fixes auto reload of file changed by Sublime Text editor.

This pack includes TeXWord.exe in both Win32 and Win64 builds

It should work with version 10.80

To apply the fix just unpack http://www.bakoma-tex.com/dist/x1080/fix/texword-sublime.zip 
in BaKoMa TeX folder. 

Check that the files 
C:\BaKoMa TeX\BIN\Win32\TeXWord.exe
C:\BaKoMa TeX\BIN\Win64\TeXWord.exe
have been replaced. 

Problem description:

Sublime Text editor saves files in two steps: (1) clear file content (2) write file.
As result TeXWord receives two events. In first event reloadable file is empty,
but time/size stamp is eventually got from second event, that supress reload at second event.

Problem solution:

(1) synchroniztion of time/size stamp has been made more carefully.
(2) suspend reloading of empty files.
