There is only fix of corrupt file name:

./tex/generic/pgf/frontendlayer/tikz/libraries:
...
tikzlibrarydecorations.pathmorphing.code.te

The file just renamed.

Also, I have changed extensive use of save/rstore
to use gsave/grestore, which is more efficient.

Looking source, I see that gsave/grestore is really needed.

Fix:

./tex/generic/pgf/systemlayer
