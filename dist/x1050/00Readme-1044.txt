Time Line 4-Aug-2014
--------------------

BaKoMa TeX 10.44:

  *) Support of experimantal set of Win64

     Most of user programs are linked with MSVC TDSearch-x86.dll (instead of TDSearch.dll)
     Win64 programs are linked with TDSearch-x64.dll.

  * PostLine/WIN32 is now recompiled by MSVC instead of BCC

  * Recovering of not found PSKernel.VM - reset cache, then try again.

  + Fix of template preview: approach of BKM:Buttons has been returned back
    and dialog resources ("save document properties as defaults for another documents") 
    now use BS_BUTTON with OWNERDRAW instead of BKM:Button.

  + more robust check of installed perl (it is because *.PL may be associated with text editor)

  - using/installing BIBER for biblatex ...
    (Is it possible to keep it in main distribution ?)
