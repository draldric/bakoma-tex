This fix is based on code base of V 10.51,
which fixes buffer overflow in case of href value > 256.

See test: (http://www.e-publications.org/ims/support/bj-instructions.html)

This pack includes dview.exe, texword.exe, tdsearch-x86,dll and wxWidgets 3.0

I think it also, will work with all version from 10.0 upto 10.20

NOTE: V 10.30 ... 10.40 already have wxWidgets 3.0
      V 10.50 assumes free upgrade to V 10.51
