This fix is based on code base of V 10.51,
which fixes buffer overflow in searchlibfile function.

See test: (C:\Users\BaKoMa\Google Диск\support\mrlawfej\exppaperidea-fvi-auction-101514-vsn3.tex)

This pack includes BaKoMa\Common\dvilib.ctr

The fix is compatible with V 10.10 and later, and I hope with 10.0 too.
