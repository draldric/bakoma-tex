  2! Added /PageSize key to currentpagedevice 
     Adobe Acrobat 10.1.13 uses following header:

     ...
     level2
	{Adobe_AGM_Core/AGMCORE_Default_PageSize currentpagedevice/PageSize get put}if
     ...	
     Adobe_AGM_Core/AGMCORE_Default_PageSize get 0 get currentpagedevice/PageSize get 0 get eq and
     Adobe_AGM_Core/AGMCORE_Default_PageSize get 1 get currentpagedevice/PageSize get 1 get eq and
     ...

     It is interesting that another keys are checked for existance, but /PageSize just got !!!

     Anyway, adding the key solves the problem.    

     In Changes history we can announce it as 'compatibility with PostScript saved by Acrobat 10'

<li><b>[TODO]</b> [2015/03/27] Improved <b>TIKZ/PGF</b> compatibility.
<br>Tech: Extended save limit from standard 15 to 255. Then reverted changing of save/restore to gsave/grestore. 
<br>Problem history: TIKZ/PGF easielly overflow standard limit of 15 (taking into attention 
2 extra saves for document and page). In this reason, we try to fix the problem 
by replacement of save/restore to gsave/grestore, whose are less restrictive and faster !!!
However, some bug reports has been appeared. So, that we extend the limit and revert fixes.

Handled imagemask with Pattern color space.
I currently force using black color for it.
