Revision 2014/06/10

1. Fixes ietex.dll which now rebuild by using BC 5.0 instead of BC 5.5
   I meet some situations when write memory error is appeared.

   It may be so that I use static strings as further storage, but BC 5.5 place them to RO segment.
   However, I don't know true reason of the problem and rebuild both etex.exe and ietex.dll 
   by using BC 5.0 (instead BC 5.5) that fixes problem now.

2. mdframed (it uses latex3 and now may be added)
