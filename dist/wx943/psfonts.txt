psfonts.bkz
   removed files already included in ctan modules:
	 psnfss, times, helvetic, courier, avantgar, bookman, ncntrsbk, palatino,
	 symbol, zapfchan, zapfding, 

   Also, we preserve previous font configuration.

   Note, that all mentioned CTAn modules must be processed at once,
   because in them fonts and MAp files are distributed between each other.

NOTE: SymbolEncoding (symbol.enc) has been moved from Winfonts.bkz 
	to psfonts.bkz

2011/03/11 - All PostScript fonts are substituted by default by Nimbus fonts.
	     In such way I hope to have less surprises with system fonts.

	However, I make two sections: [PSAliases-WinCore] with old records.
	and [PSAliases-Nimbus] with new records.
	The idea for future is that some tool will help user to move 
	these sections to [PSAliases] section ...
