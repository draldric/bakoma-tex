V 10.65: ...

   In addition to visible changes

   Source has been refactorized, moving some globals into TeXView members.

   afminfo.exe has been recompiled using VS2010 for Win32 and Win64

   Shift+Page[Up/Down] is added to Centaur and TeXWord Source Files window (was requested).

  BibEdit has been refined for handling empty BIB-files ...

  Centaur: File/New from Template - fixed that tab has been switched back after dialog closing ...
  It is probably because at dialog closign focus has been returned back when dialog openning.
  Such that any focus changes inside dialog are locked.

  Currently we fix Template chooser such that it restores currently creating fiel
  after such perturbations ...

  Most crucial question will extra call to findfile destroy TeXWord ?
  It looks such that TeXWord eats extra findfile without noticeable problems ...

  TEST IT MORE !!!
