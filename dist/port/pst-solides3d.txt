solides.pro 

begin dictionary but do not end it.

As I understand author's idea is 
to keep dictionary open acros document,
that isn't posible in many cases 
such that BaKoMa TeX even do not allow it.

Simple fix may be in removing '%SolidesDict begin'

However, even after this fix PostScript hangs for extremly long time.

Even drawn images (i.e. geode42_direct.tex ) 
work so long that editing text (in TeXWord) with such 
imaging isn't reasonable.

RESUME: WE DO NOT RECOMEND TO USE THIS PACKAGE.
