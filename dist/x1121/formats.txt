2017-Jan-28 Revision adds search in plain forlder for all LaTeX formats.

Really, only TEXMF.INI records will be changed.

2010-Jun-08 Revision was changed in order to force update.

Old:

:formats:v903:0.015:109111972:6501:7B93-9BAE:

New:

:formats:v903:0.015:109111973:6501:7B93-9BAE:

It is becasue Script/Resource.Dir file was ovrwriten by bakoma.bkz
after filling form formats.bkz:Update/formats.ini
Now I move filling of Script/Resource.Dir to bakoma.bkz:Update/bakoma.ini
So, it will O'K for new installations. 
However, by forcing reinstalling formats.bkz I will also fix old installations
in update mode.


NOTE: I needn't to rebuild new formats.bkz, because archive itself was unchanged.
