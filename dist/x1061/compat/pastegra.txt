BaKoMa TeX beginning from V 10.61 has buil-in PasteGra function,
which is supported on all platforms.

However, Pastegra.exe/Win32 has some extended features such as saving 
clipboard in PostScript format when it is possible (WxWidgets can't touch it).

So, V 10.61 has no PasteGra by default and use portable solution as on all other platforms.

However, users whose need saving Postscript can install old PasteGra by unpacking this ZIP file.

BaKoMa TeX checks existing external PasteGra, and launch it it is available.
