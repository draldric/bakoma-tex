This fix is based on code base of V 10.63,
which fixes buffer name pool overflow in PostWin.

This pack includes postwin.exe, tdsearch-x86.dll

I think it will work with all versions from 10.0 upto 10.20

To apply the fix just unpack http://www.bakoma-tex.com/dist/x1063/fix/postwin-vc86-64K.zip
in BaKoMa TeX folder. 

Check that the file 
C:\BaKoMa TeX\BIN\Win32\PostWin.exe
has been replaced. 

try to reuse the function to check effect.

--- Fix itself ---

1) Pool Name has been extended from 32K to 64K
2) PostWin has been rebuild by using VS 2010 instead of BC 5.0
