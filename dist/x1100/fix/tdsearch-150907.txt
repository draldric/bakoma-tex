This fix (2015/09/07) is based on code base of V 11.0,
which should improve speed of openning files under Windows 10.

This pack includes TDSearch-*.dll in both Win32 and Win64 builds

It should work with version 11.0

To apply the fix just unpack 
http://www.bakoma-tex.com/dist/x1100/fix/tdsearch-150907.zip 
in BaKoMa TeX folder. 

Check that the files 
C:\BaKoMa TeX\BIN\Win32\tdsearch-x86.dll
C:\BaKoMa TeX\BIN\Win64\tdsearch-x64.dll
have been replaced. 

Fix background:

We avoid attempt of creating arbitrary not found TEX files (running mktextex).
This run is allowed only for *.FD files.
