There is collection of packages made from language package set.


There are only russian modules now. (need to revision)

----------- Other modules are moved or reused from ctan. ------------

Following modules should be used from 'ctan'

   -	allrunes.bkz	-> fonts (CTAN version has mismatched tfm names in FD)
   *	arabi.bkz
   *	arabtex.bkz
	
   *	kerkis.bkz
   +	tipa.bkz
   +	vntex.bkz
	   urw.bkz is included into ctan/vntex.bkz
	   vninput.bkz is already moved to formats.bkz
   -	antykwa.bkz	(ctan/antt.bkz)

So, after moving we must pass soem tests ...

Following modules are absent in CTAN.
(It is interesting that they are missed in MikTeX)

   >	qfonts.bkz
	   It looks such that it tex-gyre fonts.

   >	rawfonts.bkz (was coming with cstex)
	   It is possible that raw ps fonts are included anywhere...
	   I get rptmr and find it at times.bkz.

   >	rgrfonts.bkz	->  fonts/yannisgr
	   They are ctan/yannisgr, however we include 
	   Type3 fonts. So that we must place then under name 
	   fonts/yannisgr

They should be just moved to 'fonts' folder.
