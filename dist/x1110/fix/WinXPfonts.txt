Problem:
-------

When using Windows fonts (Times, Arial, Courier, etc.)
some international glyhs are disappear in exported 
PDF, PostScript, and eventually SVG.

The problem may be appeared under Windows VISTA/7/8/10

Reason:
------

The reason is that configuration for standard fonts
has been generated under Windows XP.

Solution:
--------

One solution is adding to BaKoMa TeX TrueType fonts from Windows XP.

Step by Step:

1) Copy TrueType from Windows XP (C:\Windows\Fonts)
   to BaKoMa TeX (C:\BaKoMa TeX\LOCAL\fonts\truetype\WinXP)

   NOTE: There is copy of fonts:
         http://www.bakoma-tex.com/dist/x1110/fix/WinXPfonts.zip
         Just unpack archive into 'C:\BaKoMa TeX\LOCAL' folder.

2) Rebuild ls-R 
   Options / Common Settings -> Directories, select $TEXMFLOCAL, click [(Re)Build ls-R] button.

3) Clear 'C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\BaKoMa VAR\fonts' folder.
