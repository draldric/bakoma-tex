This fix (2016/01/27) is based on code base of V 11.10,
which fix problem of crashing TeXWord when open docs
with very long file names (more then 57 letters).

Tech: is overflow of 64 byte buffer in savestate-rle algorithm.

This pack includes BIN\Win32\ietex.dll and BIN\Win64\ietex.dll

It should work with version 11.10

To apply the fix just unpack 
http://www.bakoma-tex.com/dist/x1110/fix/ietex-dll-fix160127.zip 
in BaKoMa TeX folder. 

Check that the files 
C:\BaKoMa TeX\BIN\Win32\ietex.dll and C:\BaKoMa TeX\BIN\Win64\ietex.dll
have been replaced.
